Questions to ask 

lesson 1.2

What is React DOM?
ReactDOM.render() function uses an HTML node to replace it with JSX. Essentially that's everything needed to integrate React into any application which uses HTML. In more detail, 
ReactDOM.render() expects two arguments; the first is to render the JSX. It creates an instance of your App component, though it can also pass simple JSX without any component 
instantiation.
The second argument specifies where the React application enters your HTML. It expects an element with an id='root', found in the public/index.html file. This is a basic HTML file.

Show Me: Open the public/index.html to see where the React application enters your HTML.

What is a component?
Functional Components: Functional components are simply javascript functions. We can create a functional component in React by writing a javascript function.

Class Components: The class components are a little more complex than the functional components. The functional components are not aware of the other components in your program whereas 
the class components can work with each other. We can pass data from one class component to other class components. We can use JavaScript ES6 classes to create class-based components in 
React.

component trees:

There is usually one uppermost entry point component (e.g. App) that spans a tree of components below it. The App is the parent component of the List and Search, so the List and Search are 
child components of the App component and sibling components to each other.
